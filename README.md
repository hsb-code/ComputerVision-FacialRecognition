This is a facial recognition project using python library "Facial Recognition" and OpenCV.
The project has been done in two modes. One using builtin laptop cam.
The file named "main.py" is code for using builtin laptop camera.
The other mode is using esp32-cam.
You can access that code via file "espcam.py".
Code for arduino ide to access espcam is also provided with helping material.
The other necessary code files are also uploaded.
You can make your full fledged facial recognition system and use it at any required application!
I have provided the graphics as well.
Feel free to contact if you commit any problem.
